# Instruction_Set_Architecture

This is hard coding 10 decimal digit Instruction set architecture which deals with operators and loop.
There is a file that provide steps which has ZRO, I, SUM, AVG, N, TMP, DTA, READ, LABL, GE, SUB, PUTA, LOOP, MOVE, GETA, ADD, DIV, PRNT, and STOP.

ZRO, I, SUM, AVG, N, TMP, and DTA are variables.
READ, LABL, GE, SUB, PUTA, LOOP, MOVE, GETA, ADD, DIV, PRNT, and STOP are functions.
There are 3 parts. 
Bios: Getting data from the file, and store in memory.
Memory: Encoding the data from bios. 
CPU: Based on the encoded data, operate coding.
